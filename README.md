========

<b>demoLecture2</b> -- Using TRIS, PORT, and LATCH to control and LED by switch 1 on the development board.<br>
<b>demoLecture3-polling</b> -- Using the 'polling' method involved interrupts. This toggles an LED when switch 1 on the development board is pressed.<br>
<b>demoLecture3-CN-USR</b> -- Using an ISR to handle a change notification interrupt. This toggles an LED when switch 1 on the development board is pressed.<br>
<b>demoLecture4-floatingPin</b> -- Demonstrating the value of a floating pin being neither '0' nor '1'.<br>
<b>demoLecture4-nonCN</b> -- Showing that it takes non-zero time for a pin to become 'high' or 'low'.<br>
<b>demoLecture4-CN</b> -- Use a CN interrupt to capture the change of a value on a pin.<br>
<b>demoLecture4-LEDs</b> -- Use an FSM and CN Interrupt to change LEDs on a button press.<br>
<b>demoLecture5-timedLED</b> -- Blinking an LED using a timer interrupt.<br>
<b>demoLecture5-delayLED</b> -- Blinking and LED using a timer delay.<br>
<b>demoLecture5-DDR</b> -- The famous one-button DDR.<br>
<b>demoLecture6-LCD</b> -- Introducing some of the LCD functions. This program will not work on its own.<br>
<b>demoLecture7-32BitTimer</b> -- Blink and LED with a 32-bit timer<br>
<b>demoLecture8-keypad</b> -- DDR with a keypad. However, the keypad needs to be implemented.<br>
<b>demoLecture9-UARTchat</b> -- Chatting between two UARTs. This code has not been tested.<br>
<b>demoLecture10-UARTchat</b> -- UART testing demonstration. <br>
<b>demoLecture11-oScope</b> -- This implements an ADC and PWM. The ADC can be used to make a primitive oscilloscope. <br>
<b>demoLecture13-spi</b> -- This is a basic implementation of SPI. This must be modified to work with a particular device.<br>
<b>demoLecture14-spi-acc</b> -- This is meant to use SPI to work with an accelerometer.<br>
