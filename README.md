<b>demoLecture2</b> -- Using TRIS, PORT, and LATCH to control and LED by switch 1 on the development board.<br>
<b>demoLecture3-polling</b> -- Using the 'polling' method involved interrupts. This toggles an LED when switch 1 on the development board is pressed.<br>
<b>demoLecture3-CN-USR</b> -- Using an ISR to handle a change notification interrupt. This toggles an LED when switch 1 on the development board is pressed.<br>
<b>demoLecture4-floatingPin</b> -- Demonstrating the value of a floating pin being neither '0' nor '1'.<br>
<b>demoLecture4-nonCN</b> -- Showing that it takes non-zero time for a pin to become 'high' or 'low'.<br>
<b>demoLecture4-CN</b> -- Use a CN interrupt to capture the change of a value on a pin.<br>
<b>demoLecture4-LEDs</b> -- Use an FSM and CN Interrupt to change LEDs on a button press.<br>
<b>demoLecture5-timedLED</b> -- Blinking an LED using a timer interrupt.<br>
<b>demoLecture5-delayLED</b> -- Blinking and LED using a timer delay.<br>
<b>demoLecture5-DDR</b> -- The famous one-button DDR.<br>
<b>demoLecture6-LCD</b> -- Introducing some of the LCD functions. This program will not work on its own.<br>
<b>demoLecture7-32BitTimer<b> -- Blink and LED with a 32-bit timer
